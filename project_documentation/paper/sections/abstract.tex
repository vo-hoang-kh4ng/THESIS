\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an advanced social media monitoring system that leverages a multi-agent architecture to perform real-time sentiment analysis and crisis detection. The system employs CrewAI to coordinate specialized agents for data collection, analysis, and reporting across various social media platforms. Our approach combines natural language processing, machine learning, and real-time data processing to provide comprehensive brand monitoring and crisis detection capabilities. The system's effectiveness is demonstrated through case studies involving real-world social media data, showing significant improvements in crisis detection accuracy and response time compared to traditional monitoring approaches. The results indicate that our multi-agent system can effectively identify potential crises, analyze sentiment trends, and generate actionable insights for brand management.
