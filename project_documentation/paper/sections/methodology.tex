\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Architecture}
The system is built on a multi-agent architecture using CrewAI, where each agent is specialized for specific tasks in the social media monitoring pipeline. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient in processing real-time data streams.

\subsubsection{Core Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent System}: A collection of specialized agents working in coordination
    \item \textbf{Task Pipeline}: A structured flow of tasks from data collection to report generation
    \item \textbf{Tools Integration}: Various tools for data collection, analysis, and processing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent Design}
Each agent in the system is designed with specific roles and capabilities:

\subsubsection{Specialist Agents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Social Media Researcher}: Gathers comprehensive data from various platforms
    \item \textbf{Social Media Monitor}: Tracks engagement metrics and trends
    \item \textbf{Sentiment Analyzer}: Performs detailed sentiment analysis
    \item \textbf{Report Generator}: Creates comprehensive reports
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Support Agents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coordinator}: Manages and synthesizes outputs from specialist agents
    \item \textbf{Support Agent}: Provides additional context and validation
    \item \textbf{Memory Agent}: Stores and retrieves historical data
    \item \textbf{Re-ranking Agent}: Optimizes final outputs
    \item \textbf{Crisis Detector}: Monitors and detects potential crises
\end{itemize}
